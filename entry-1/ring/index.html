    Qays ibn al-Mulawwah was just a boy when he fell deeply in love with       
    Layla Al-Aamiriya. He was sure of this love on the very first day he       
    laid eyes upon her at school. He soon began to write beautiful love poems  
    about Layla and he would read them out loud on street corners to anybody   
    who would care to listen. Such passionate displays of love and devotion    
    caused many to refer to the boy as Majnun, meaning madman. One day, Majnun 
    found the courage to ask Layla’s father for his daughter’s hand in         
    marriage, but her father refused the request. Such a marriage, the father  
    reasoned, would only cause a scandal. It would not be proper for his       
    daughter to marry a person whom everybody called 'madman'. Instead, Layla  
    was promised to another. Majnun was overcome with grief and abandoned his  
    home and family and disappeared into the wilderness.                       
                                                                            
    He lived a miserable life of solitude among the wild animals, spending     
    his days composing poems to his beloved Layla. Layla was forced to marry   
    another man and, although she did not love him because her heart still     
    belonged to Majnun, she remained a faithful wife. The news of this         
    marriage was devastating to Majnun who continued to live a life of         
    solitude. Majnun’s mother and father missed their son terribly and longed  
    every day for his safe return home.                                        
                                                                            
    Knowing of his devotion to his parents, Layla was determined to send       
    Majnun word of their passing. Eventually she found an old man who claimed  
    to have seen Majnun in the desert. After much begging and pleading, the    
    old man agreed to pass on a message. When the old man delivered the news   
    of Majnun’s parents' passing, Majnun was overcome with grief.              
                                                                                
    Layla's husband eventually died, but tradition demanded Layla grieve for   
    two years. She could not bear this, and eventually, she died of a broken   
    heart. Hearing the news, Majnun traveled to Layla's grave, where he        
    wept until he, too, succumbed to grief.
